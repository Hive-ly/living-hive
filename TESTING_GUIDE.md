# Testing Guide: Dynamic vs Hard-coded Embeddings

This guide walks you through testing both dynamic (real API) and hard-coded (mock) embedding modes.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up OpenAI API Key**:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
   ```

## Step 1: Generate Stories (Optional)

If you want to use Reddit stories instead of the default ones:

```bash
npm run fetch-stories
```

This will:

- Fetch ~150 stories from r/work subreddit
- Sanitize them using OpenAI (remove NSFW, personal info, etc.)
- Save ~100 clean stories to `examples/src/data/sampleStories.json`

**Note:** This requires your OpenAI API key and may take a few minutes.

## Step 2: Generate Mock Embeddings

Generate embeddings for your stories and save them as mock data:

```bash
npm run regenerate-embeddings
```

This will:

- Read stories from `examples/src/data/sampleStories.json` (or fall back to BasicExample stories)
- Generate embeddings using OpenAI API
- Save embeddings to `examples/src/data/mockEmbeddings.json`

**Note:** This requires your OpenAI API key and may take a few minutes depending on the number of stories.

## Step 3: Test Dynamic Embeddings (Real API Calls)

1. **Make sure `VITE_USE_MOCK_EMBEDDINGS` is NOT set** (or set to `false`):

   ```bash
   # In .env.local, either omit it or set:
   VITE_USE_MOCK_EMBEDDINGS=false
   ```

2. **Make sure you have `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` set** in `.env.local`

3. **Start the dev server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open the Basic Example** in your browser

5. **What to expect**:
   - The component will make real API calls to OpenAI
   - You'll see loading states while embeddings are generated
   - Embeddings are cached (ref-based) so subsequent renders won't regenerate them
   - Check the browser console/network tab to see API calls

## Step 4: Test Hard-coded Embeddings (Mock Mode)

1. **Set `VITE_USE_MOCK_EMBEDDINGS=true`** in `.env.local`:

   ```bash
   VITE_USE_MOCK_EMBEDDINGS=true
   ```

2. **Restart the dev server** (if running):

   ```bash
   # Stop the server (Ctrl+C) and restart:
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open the Basic Example** in your browser

4. **What to expect**:
   - No API calls to OpenAI (check network tab)
   - Instant loading (embeddings loaded from JSON)
   - You'll see "Using mock embeddings (no API calls)" message
   - Much faster initial load

## Quick Comparison

| Feature          | Dynamic Embeddings                        | Hard-coded Embeddings           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| API Calls        | Yes (OpenAI)                              | No                              |
| Initial Load     | ~10 seconds (22 stories)                  | Instant                         |
| Requires API Key | Yes                                       | No (for viewing)                |
| Use Case         | Development, testing                      | Production demos                |
| Environment Var  | `VITE_USE_MOCK_EMBEDDINGS=false` or unset | `VITE_USE_MOCK_EMBEDDINGS=true` |

## Troubleshooting

### Mock embeddings not loading

- Make sure `mockEmbeddings.json` exists and has data
- Run `npm run regenerate-embeddings` to generate embeddings
- Check that story IDs in `sampleStories.json` match the IDs used in `BasicExample.tsx`

### API calls still happening in mock mode

- Make sure `.env.local` has `VITE_USE_MOCK_EMBEDDINGS=true`
- Restart the dev server after changing env vars
- Check browser console for any errors

### Stories not found

- If `sampleStories.json` doesn't exist, the script will fall back to extracting stories from `BasicExample.tsx`
- Or run `npm run fetch-stories` first to generate stories

## Files Reference

- `examples/src/data/sampleStories.json` - Story data (generated by `fetch-stories`)
- `examples/src/data/mockEmbeddings.json` - Pre-computed embeddings (generated by `regenerate-embeddings`)
- `examples/src/examples/BasicExample.tsx` - Example component that uses both modes
- `.env.local` - Environment variables (not committed to git)
